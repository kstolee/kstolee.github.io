</p>
<p>
In our <a href="../esem2011.pdf">ESEM 2011 paper</a>, we analyze a sample of 32,887 artifacts from the Yahoo! Pipes repository. We make the data used in our analysis available here. If you are interested in the JSON representations of the artifacts, please contact me directly.
</p>
<div class="bar">Artifact Summaries</div>
<p>
This data was used for the majority of the tables and figures in the paper. Specifically, the data for Tables II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XII, XIII and Figure 3 comes from the artifact summaries. This data set includes the following information for each row,  where the left column corresponds to the column in the data set provided below, next to a description of its value:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td><bold>id:</bold></td><td>The pipe's identifier, as defined by Yahoo! Note that some of the pipes may have changed since we ran our scraper, but the id can be used to view the pipe's structure and content on Yahoo!'s servers </td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>author:</bold></td><td>An identifier for the author of the pipe</td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>prol:</bold></td><td>A boolean value, 1 or 0, indicating if the author was flagged as a prolific author for the analysis</td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>authpipes:</bold></td><td>The number of pipes within our sample created by the author</td></tr>

<div class="bar">Rolling Cluster Analysis</div>
<p>
We perform a rolling diversity analysis within each of the most prolific authors, as described in Section VII: <i>Analysis of the Most Prolific Authors</i>.  The data for Figure 2 and Tables X, XI comes from the rolling cluster analysis. For each author, we sort the pipes they created by date, and then compare the level at which each pipe was clusterd considering all the pipes created before it. Each row in the data set contains the following information:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td><bold>level:</bold></td><td>The level at which <i>pipe2</i> was clustered</td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>author:</bold></td><td>The author who created the pipes</td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>pipe1:</bold></td><td>The ID of the pipe that was added just before pipe2 was added</td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>pipe2:</bold></td><td>The ID of the pipe being clustered</td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>date1:</bold></td><td>The creation date of pipe1</td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>date2:</bold></td><td>The creation date of pipe2</td></tr>
<tr><td><bold>between:</bold></td><td>The days between the creation dates of pipe1 and pipe2</td></tr>
</table>
