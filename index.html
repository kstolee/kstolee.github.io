  <p><b>Bio:</b> I am an Associate Professor in the <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at North Carolina State University.
 I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in August 2013 from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln as a member of the ESQuaReD lab under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="http://cse.unl.edu/~elbaum">Sebastian Elbaum</a>.

  <p>
  My research makes innovative contributions to our knowledge of program analysis, human aspects of software engineering, and their intersection.
As examples, I have explored how refactoring a regular expression can improve comprehension (<a href="papers/ase2017.pdf">pdf</a>), how a constraint solver can identify code for a human to reuse (<a href="papers/TOSEM2014.pdf">pdf</a>), and how cross-language code-to-code search may help developers learn a new language (<a href="papers/ICSE2020.pdf">pdf</a>).
 These efforts combine analysis (refactoring, semantic code search, code-to-code search) with human factors (comprehension, reuse, learning). 
 The innovative and influential nature of this research has been recognized by the computer science community at large, as
 I have been awarded over $1,500,000 in federal grants including an NSF CAREER award. 
In addition to my scholarly contributions, I am active in the software engineering research community's top conferences as an author, reviewer, and organizer. 
I am intentional about mentoring the next generation, especially women. <i>Fun fact: three of my papers have all-female authors (<a href="papers/saner2019regex.pdf">1</a>)(<a href="papers/fse2018.pdf">2</a>)(<a href="papers/ieesoftware2018.pdf">3</a>).</i>
