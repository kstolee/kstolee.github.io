  <p><b>Bio:</b> I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at North Carolina State University and the recipient of an NSF CAREER award. 
Previously, from 2013 - 2015, I was the Harpole-Pentair Assistant Professor of Software Engineering at Iowa State University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in August 2013 from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln as a member of the ESQuaReD lab under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="http://cse.unl.edu/~elbaum">Sebastian Elbaum</a>.

<div class="bar">Research Interests</div>

  <p>
 My research interests are in software engineering, focusing on three primary areas: 
    1) code search, 2) program repair,  3) regular expression testing and analysis, 4) testing education, and 5) empirical studies.  
 Although code search is an integrated part of modern development practices, 
current search tools support textual queries but ignore a critical component of source code: its behavior. 
    During my PhD, I developed a <a href="papers/TOSEM2014.pdf">code search approach</a> based on behavior that uses symbolic execution and a constraint solver to
    identify exact or close matches to an input/output query. 
While effective at finding relevant code snippets for reuse, semantic code search is also an effective engine 
    behind program repair. The patches located through semantic code search have <a href="papers/ase2015.pdf">measurably higher quality</a> 
    compared to prior techniques.
One source of bugs that is difficult to repair comes from regular expressions, and these bugs can be catastrophic.
    Repairability is limited in part because <a href="papers/fse2018.pdf">regular expressions are under-tested</a>;  
    we am developing techniques to improve regular expression quality.
