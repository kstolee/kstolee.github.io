<div class="bar">Research Interests</div>

  <p>
 My research interests are in the areas of program analysis, code search, and empirical software engineering.
 My prior work in program analysis includes encoding programs as constraints for the purpose of code search with I/O examples  and is the first  to use behavioral specifications with constraint solvers for code search. Additionally, I have transformed web mashup programs through refactoring. In empirical software engineering, I have designed and run nearly a dozen  empirical studies with human participants, using crowdsourcing for many of those.
</p>
<!--  My research has a common thread of leveraging resources in software code repositories to better support programmers. In the past, the primary target of my approaches has been end-user programmers, with techniques that aim to increase the quality of programs (i.e., through refactoring [ICSE 2011]) or to help programmers find code that solves a particular problem (i.e., semantic search with lightweight specifications [FSE NIER 2012, ICSE Doctoral Symposium 2012]). More recently we are taking the semantic search approach to a broader audience, targeting more mainstream programming languages like SQL and Java. These techniques have been evaluated using different empirical methods, including crowdsourcing, which can enable large-scale and cost-effective evaluation [ESEM 2010].
  </p>
  <p>To gain a better understanding of programmers and their communities, I have also conducted several exploratory empirical studies (i.e., on duplication in Yahoo! Pipes [ESEM 2011], on programming language usage in Kodu [SIGCSE 2011], on copy/paste behaviors [VL/HCC 2009]). 
  
My research focuses on software engineering for end users, and I aim to enable end users to create dependable 
programs by bringing the benefits of software engineering to the growing community of end users.  
I approach this problem by creating tools and techniques that promote community-based collaborations 
among users, allow users to learn from the experiences and expertise of others, 
and provide dependability support for user tasks.

Related to computer science education,
I have contributed to an online instructional tool, BugHunt (offline now), 
that teaches software testing techniques through a series of tutorials. I have also held an internship at the
Microsoft FUSE Labs and studied <a href="http://fuse.microsoft.com/project/kodu.aspx">Kodu</a>, an educational
programming language designed for children.
