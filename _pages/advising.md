Check out the main [squaresLab@CMU website](http://squareslab.github.io) for
more information on my group and students, and our various research projects.

**Research advising:** If you are a CMU student (grad or undergrad, in any school or program
program) interested in working with me, send an email (CC my admin, Jenni!) to
set up an appointment. Be prepared to talk about research problems you find
interesting. My current projects and recent publications are good starting
points, but coming with your own ideas about interesting problems/potential
solutions in analysis/transformation/search-based software engineering for
improving software quality will only impress me, so don’t feel limited by what
I’m currently doing. 

*Non-CMU students:* You may apply to several of the PhD programs at CMU’s School
of Computer Science at once; apply to those that match your interest area and
background. If you are interested in working with me, apply to
the [S3D SE PhD program](https://se-phd.isri.cmu.edu/). 
Mention (and substantiate/justify!) your interest in my work to ensure that I
see your application. Note that the SE PhD program does not look at GRE scores
and does not have an application fee; see our website for details.

I discourage prospective PhD students from emailing me outside of application
season about their plans to apply; I'll simply repeat the above. 

*Non-CMU PhD students interested in visiting:* please contact me directly. Note
that your chances will be much better if you secure an outside fellowship to
support your visit, and even better than that if your research advisor emails me
as well.

**Masters students:** The [Masters of Software Engineering](https://mse.isri.cmu.edu/) is an
industry/practitioner-oriented (rather than a research-oriented) degree. I do
not participate in the MSE admissions process. If you’d like to do research with
me, apply to our PhD program instead. If you are a current MSE student who has
developed an interest in research, contact me as noted above.

**Undergraduate summer research:**  With [Josh
Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/) and [Charlie
Garrod](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/), I co-founded and co-direct the
[REUSE@CMU](http://reuse.cs.cmu.edu/) summer program.

REUSE@CMU provides summer research opportunities to undergrads interested in
Interdisciplinary Software Engineering.   We train students in all elements of
research, including understanding literature, formulating research questions,
developing novel solutions, and evaluating and communicating results.  Our
students regularly publish, and win awards in student research competitions; a
number of our graduates have applied to and been accepted at top graduate
programs.

The vast majority of my group's summer research interns come through this
program. We're interested in students from all walks of life: from rising
freshmen to rising seniors and from regional state schools to small liberal
schools to R1. Head over to the main site to learn more and apply!

**Undergraduate advising otherwise:** CMU undergrads: I encourage you to check out the
[Undergraduate Minor/Concentration in Software
Engineering](https://s3d.cmu.edu/education/undergrad/se-minor/index.html)!
[Michael Hilton](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/) directs the program.

*Please note that I do not participate in (and indeed know remarkably little
about) [CMU/SCS undergraduate](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/undergraduate-programs)
admissions.*

## Teaching history

I provide the below for completeness; it also gives some hint as to what I might
be teaching in the next year or two.

I also typically contribute to 17-808, Introduction to
Software Engineering Research, as a member of the core faculty in Software
Engineering (I coordinated, 2015-2017).
