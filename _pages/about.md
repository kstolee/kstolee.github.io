I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University.
After graduating from the [Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management](https://raikes.unl.edu/), I built a career in software engineering and software engineering education research and received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln under the supervision of [Sebastian Elbaum](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~se4ja/).

My research makes innovative contributions to our knowledge of software engineering from a **technical perspective** (e.g., program analysis), **human perspective** (e.g., human aspects of software engineering, software product management),  and **educational perspective** (e.g., comparative comprehension of algorithms). 
As examples, I have explored how refactoring a regular expression can improve comprehension [(pdf)](assets/papers/ase2017.pdf), how a constraint solver can identify code for a human to reuse [(pdf)](assets/papers/TOSEM2014.pdf), and how cross-language code-to-code search may help developers learn a new language [(pdf)](assets/papers/ICSE2020.pdf).
 These efforts combine analysis (refactoring, semantic code search, code-to-code search) with human factors (comprehension, reuse, learning). 
 The innovative and influential nature of this research has been recognized by the computer science community at large, as
 I have been awarded over $2,000,000 in federal grants including an NSF CAREER award. 
In addition to my scholarly contributions, I am active in the software engineering research community's top conferences as an author, reviewer, and organizer. 
I am intentional about mentoring the next generation.
