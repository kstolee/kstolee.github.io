Search is an embedded process in modern software development, and it's not going anywhere. Search is used to help developers find code to reuse, find API examples, and explore documentation. This talk explores my recent research in code search for software engineering, including understanding why developers search, how we can make search more precise, and how behavioral code search can enable automated program repair.
