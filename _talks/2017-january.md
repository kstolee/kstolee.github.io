Regular expressions are commonly used in source code, yet developers find them hard to read, hard to write, and hard to compose. Motivated by the prevalence of regular expression usage in practice and the number of bug reports related to regular expressions, I propose several future directions for studying regular expressions, including error classification, test coverage, test input generation, reuse, and automated program repair. The repair strategies can work in the presence or absence of fault localization, and with or without test cases. I conclude by discussing the potential impact of integrating regex support into automated program repair approaches.
