Gender stereotypes about women’s computing ability contribute to
the dearth of women in computing by causing women to experience
gender bias. These gender stereotypes are doubly disadvantaging to
women because they create gender diferences in self-assessments
of computing ability, decreasing the likelihood that women will
persist in Computer Science (CS). This is because students need to
believe they have sufcient ability in a feld in order to pursue it as
a career. This talk presents an intervention to increase women's persistence intentions in CS.
